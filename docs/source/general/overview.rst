Road Map
--------

Version 1
~~~~~~~~~

ZapGo provides a REST API and administration dashboard for managing transactions and users.

All transaction logic, accounting and validations are done by the ZapGo server.

**Benefits**

- **Open Innovation**:

  Open API for anyone to innovate and rapidly deploy, launch and manage FinTech Apps.

  Examples:
   * `Blink <http://www.paywithblink.com>`_ - Retail payments with cryptocurrency in South Africa
   * `Air <http://www.airbacked.com>`_ - Global Mobile Money system
   * `ZapGo <https://www.zapgo.co>`_ - Peer to peer and bitcoin payments app in South Africa

Version 2
~~~~~~~~~
Transactions are stored on public or private blockchains.
We provide development and management tools for Openchain, Open Assets, Sidechains, Ethereum, Stellar, Ripple.

Clients Issue tokens on blockchain independent from the ZapGo platform. ZapGo provides the administration panel for managing funds, loading user accounts, managing user information, permissions and transactions.

**Benefits**

- **Open Innovation**

- **Interoperability**:

  A blockchain provides a common protocol and common source of truth for all the systems built on top of it. Merchants, third-party exchanges and other financial institutions are immediately interoperable.

- **Transparency**:

  The blockchain is maintained by multiple trusted parties (federated/ private blockchain) or a decentralised network of participants who are incentivized to maintain the integrity of the network (proof of work/ public blockchain).

Version 3
~~~~~~~~~
ZapGo provides open source libraries for constructing transactions client side. This means funds are kept on user devices and transactions are verified on a public or private blockchain. ZapGo manages the backup and recovery procedures for when user devices get lost (via HD wallet backup and/ or NLockTime recovery to a ZapGo controlled wallet). Management of funds is still done via the ZapGo administration dashboard which support multisignature permissions and hardware wallet key management for administrative functions.

**Benefits**

- **Open Innovation**

- **Interoperability**

- **Transparency**

- **Immutability**

  ZapGo facilitates the management and record keeping of funds as well as recovery and risk management procedures, but does not have the ability to alter user balances or override administrator actions. Compared to current financial services platforms, this model is robust, secure and scalable
